*Note: This README was generated by AI based on the project codebase.*

## Overview
Code to TXT is a Replit extension that helps developers gather their code files into a single text file, making it easier to work with Large Language Models (LLMs). The extension provides a user-friendly interface to select specific files and folders from your codebase.

## Features
- 🔍 Scans your codebase while intelligently skipping common non-code directories (node_modules, .git, etc.)
- ✅ Auto-selects common code file types (.js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx, .py, .json, .html, .css)
- 📁 Folder-based selection/deselection with partial state support
- 📊 Shows line count statistics for files and folders
- 📝 Generates a structured text file with:
  - Table of contents (file tree)
  - Complete file contents
  - Timestamped output files

## Technical Details
- Built with React and TypeScript
- Uses Replit Extensions API for file system operations
- Implements efficient file scanning with concurrent reads
- Handles large codebases with pagination and size limits

## Usage
1. Click "Scan Codebase" to analyze your project
2. Select/deselect files and folders as needed
3. Click "Generate a TXT File" to create the output
4. Find your generated file named `code-to-text-{timestamp}.txt`

## File Size Limits
- Maximum file size: ~2MB (in base64 form)
- Automatically skips binary files (images, PDFs, etc.)

## Development
The extension is built using:
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- @replit/extensions API
